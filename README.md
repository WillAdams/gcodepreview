# gcodepreview

PythonSCAD library for moving a tool in lines and arcs so as to model how a part would be cut using G-Code, so as to allow PythonSCAD to function as a compleat CAD/CAM solution for subtractive 3-axis CNC (mills or routers at this time, 4th-axis support may come in a future version) by writing out G-code in addition to 3D modeling (in certain cases toolpaths which would not normally be feasible), and to write out DXF files which may be imported into a traditional CAM program to create toolpaths.

Updated to make use of Python in OpenSCAD:[^rapcad]

[^rapcad]: Previous versions had used RapCAD, so as to take advantage of the writeln command, which has since been re-written in Python.

https://pythonscad.org/ (previously this was http://www.guenther-sohler.net/openscad/ )

A BlockSCAD file for the initial version of the 
main modules is available at:

https://www.blockscad3d.com/community/projects/1244473

The project is discussed at:

https://willadams.gitbook.io/design-into-3d/programming

Since it is now programmed using Literate Programming (initially a .dtx, now a .tex file) there is a PDF: https://github.com/WillAdams/gcodepreview/blob/main/gcodepreview.pdf which includes all of the source code with formatted comments.

The files for this library are:

 - gcodepreview.py (gcpy) --- the Python class/functions and variables
 - gcodepreview.scad (gcpscad) --- OpenSCAD modules and parameters

And there several sample/template files which may be used as the starting point for a given project:

 - gcodepreviewtemplate.scad (gcptmpl) --- .scad example file
 - gcodepreviewtemplate.py (gcptmplpy) --- .py example file 
 - gcpdxf.py (gcpdxfpy) --- .py example file which only makes dxf file(s) and which will run in "normal" Python in addition to PythonSCAD
 - gcpgc.py (gcpgc) --- .py example which loads a G-code file and generates a 3D preview showing how the G-code will cut

If using from PythonSCAD, place the files in C:\Users\\\~\Documents\OpenSCAD\libraries [^libraries] or, load them from Github using the command:

    nimport("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillAdams/gcodepreview/refs/heads/main/gcodepreview.py")

[^libraries]: C:\Users\\\~\Documents\RapCAD\libraries is deprecated since RapCAD is no longer needed since Python is now used for writing out files.

If using gcodepreview.scad call as:

    use <gcodepreview.py>
    include <gcodepreview.scad>

Note that it is necessary to use the first file (this allows loading the Python commands and then include the last file (which allows using OpenSCAD variables to selectively implement the Python commands via their being wrapped in OpenSCAD modules) and define variables which match the project and then use commands such as:

    opengcodefile(Gcode_filename);
    opendxffile(DXF_filename);
    
    gcp = gcodepreview(true, true);

    setupstock(219, 150, 8.35, "Top", "Center");
    
    movetosafeZ();
    
    toolchange(102, 17000);
    
    cutline(219/2, 150/2, -8.35);

    stockandtoolpaths();
    
    closegcodefile();
    closedxffile();

which makes a G-code file:

![OpenSCAD template G-code file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillAdams/gcodepreview/main/gcodepreview_template.png?raw=true)

but one which could only be sent to a machine so as to cut only the softest and most yielding of materials since it makes a single full-depth pass, and which has a matching DXF which may be imported into a CAM tool --- but which it is not directly possible to assign a toolpath in readily available CAM tools (since it varies in depth from beginning-to-end which is not included in the DXF since few tools make use of that information). 

Importing this DXF and actually cutting it is discussed at:

https://forum.makerforums.info/t/rewriting-gcodepreview-with-python/88617/14

Alternately, gcodepreview.py may be placed in a Python library location and used directly from Python --- note that it is possible to use it from a "normal" Python when generating only DXFs as shown in gcpdxf.py.

In the current version, tool numbers may match those of tooling sold by Carbide 3D (ob. discl., I work for them) and other vendors, or, a vendor-neutral system may be used. 

Comments are included in the G-code to match those expected by CutViewer, allowing a direct preview without the need to maintain a tool library (for such tooling as that program supports).

Supporting OpenSCAD usage makes possible such examples as: openscad_gcodepreview_cutjoinery.tres.scad which is made from an OpenSCAD Graph Editor file:

Possible future improvements:

 - support for post-processors
 - support for 4th-axis
 - support for two-sided machining (import an STL or other file to use for stock, or possibly preserve the state after one cut and then rotate the cut stock/part)
 - support for additional tooling shapes (lollipop cutters)
 - create a single line font for use where text is wanted
 - Support BÃ©zier curves (required for fonts if not to be limited to lines and arcs) and surfaces

Note for G-code generation that it is up to the user to implement Depth per Pass so as to not take a single full-depth pass as noted above. Working from a DXF of course allows one to off-load such considerations to a specialized CAM tool.

To-do:

 - determine why one quadrant of arc command doesn't work in OpenSCAD
 - clock-wise arcs
 - add toolpath for cutting countersinks using ball-nose tool from inside working out
 - verify OpenSCAD wrapper and add any missing commands for Python
 - verify support for shaft on tooling
 - create a folder of template and sample files
 - clean up/comment out all mentions of previous versions/features/implementations/deprecated features
 - fully implement/verify describing/saving/loading tools using CutViewer comments

Deprecated feature:

 - exporting SVGs --- coordinate system differences between OpenSCAD/DXFs and SVGs would require managing the inversion of the coordinate system (using METAPOST, which shares the same orientation and which can write out SVGs may be used for future versions)
